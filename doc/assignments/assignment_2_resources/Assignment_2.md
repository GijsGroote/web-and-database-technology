**2. Client-side JavaScript**
**2.1)**
*Before you start coding, you need to have a plan of what needs to be done. Focus on your game.html page. We will later deal with splash.html in Assignment 3.*

//todo

**2.2)**
*Think about the design of your JavaScript code â€“ which aspects of your action plan can you translate into objects?*

//todo

**2.3)**
*ow that you have made your plan and decided on the use of the design patterns, start coding! Be mindful of the following requirements:*

+ Besides jQuery (covered in the course book), no other library is allowed; use "plain" JavaScript.
+ The game has to work in two major browsers.
+ Players play the game with the mouse.
+ Once a player makes a move, the validity of the move is checked and invalid moves are rejected.
+ Reduce the redundancy in the code as much as possible (improves code maintainability).
+ Create as few global variables as possible (improves code maintainability).
+ Achieve a separation between content and interaction: the client-side JavaScript must not be present in game.html (besides the obligatory script loading tags) but instead reside in the corresponding myapp/public/javascripts folder.
