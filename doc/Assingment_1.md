Does the content correspond to what you see when accessing the page with your browser? To check, save the response to a file, use .html as file ending and open it with your browser.*

**1.3)** *
What is the purpose of the X-UA-Compatible or the X-Cache tag in the header information (you should have seen one of the two or both - if you saw both, pick one to explain)?*

**1.4)** *
What does the page's Cache-Control directive mean?*
